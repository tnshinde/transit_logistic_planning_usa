**Transit Solutions for 2050: Leveraging On Demand Zones and Remix for Effective Planning**

This project focuses on leveraging public data and the **Remix platform** to design a **cost effective and equitable transit solution for 2040**. By analyzing **TAZ based** demographic, socioeconomic, and transit data, it proposes on-demand zones to address service gaps, improve a**ccessibility, and prepare for projected population and employment changes in three U.S. counties.**

_**Overview**_
This document presents insights and recommendations based on a real-world transit planning project conducted for a U.S. Transit Authority. The project focuses on integrating on-demand transit zones with existing fixed-route services to improve cost efficiency, accessibility, and equity. By utilizing the Remix platform for advanced data analysis and network planning, this initiative provides a framework for preparing transit systems for the demographic and socioeconomic shifts expected by 2040 and 2050.

_**Data Transparency**_

All information and data utilized for this analysis are available through public platforms. The demographic, socioeconomic, and transit-related layers used for this project were sourced from publicly available datasets, including TAZ (Transportation Analysis Zone) data, which offers projections for 2040 and beyond.

_**Objectives**_

Optimize Operations: Develop cost-effective transit models to serve low-density and underserved areas.
Future Proof Transit Systems: Use tools like Remix to analyze current transit gaps and project future demand.
Enhance Equity: Provide accessible transit options for populations with limited resources or mobility.
Integrate Networks: Combine fixed routes and on-demand zones into a seamless, adaptable transit network.

_**The Remix Platform**_

What is Remix?
Remix is a leading platform for transportation planning that combines powerful visualization tools with demographic and operational data to support informed decision-making. Transit authorities widely use it across the U.S. to.

Design Routes: Plan and optimize bus routes and networks for maximum efficiency and coverage.
Analyze Data: Overlay socioeconomic and geographic data for targeted transit solutions.
Forecast Demand: Model how demographic and land-use changes will impact future transit needs.

_**Key Applications in This Project**_

Equity Analysis: Identify underserved populations, such as low-income households, individuals with disabilities, and car-less residents.

On-Demand Zone Design: Plan flexible transit zones to address gaps in fixed-route service.

Future Projections: Map population growth and employment hubs to align transit development with future demand.

Leveraging Remix: Real-World Examples

The following visualizations and analyses were conducted as part of this project using Remix:

**A. Current Transit Network**

Mapped existing fixed routes to identify areas with low coverage.
Highlighted opportunities to integrate on-demand zones for improved connectivity and accessibility.

**B. Demographic and Socioeconomic Layers**

To understand how the three counties (James City County, York County, and Williamsburg) will look like in 2040 with respect to TAZ data, the following layers were analyzed:
Households Receiving Food Stamps: Identified regions with high transit dependency.
Individuals with Disabilities: Highlighted areas requiring accessible transit options.
Percentage Change in Employment: Pinpointed future employment hubs.
Projected Population Growth: Analyzed areas expected to see significant population increases.

**C. Proposed On-Demand Zone**

Designed a 17.2-square-mile on-demand zone as a pilot program, with:
Population: 10,700 residents.
Poverty Rate: 14%.
Diversity: 44% non-White or Hispanic/Latino population.
The zone was designed to connect seamlessly with existing fixed-route services.

_**D. 2040 Projections**_

Utilized TAZ data to forecast population, employment, and socioeconomic changes.
Mapped how these shifts would impact transit demand and identified areas requiring additional service.

_**On Demand Transit Zone: A Case Study**_

The success of on-demand transit systems in other U.S. cities, such as the Lynchburg Flex Zone, serves as a benchmark for implementing similar systems in this project.

**Cost Efficiency**_

Flex Zone, demonstrates significant cost savings compared to traditional fixed-route systems. The Flex Zone operates at a total cost of $70.81 per hour, substantially lower than the $133.17 per hour for fixed routes, saving $62.36 per hour. Additionally, operational costs for three vans amount to $177.03 per hour, compared to $266.34 for two buses, resulting in a projected savings of $89.31 per hour. While vehicle replacement costs for vans are slightly higher at $1,505,000 compared to $1,368,400 for buses, the operational savings justify this difference over time. In terms of ridership, the Flex Zone experienced remarkable growth, starting with just 1 rider in July 2024 and reaching 2,068 riders by October 2024, reflecting the rapid adoption and success of this flexible, demand-driven service model.

**Conclusion**

This real-world project demonstrates how U.S. transit authorities can use tools like Remix and innovative models like on-demand zones to create cost-effective, equitable, and future-ready transit systems. By leveraging public data and advanced geospatial tools, transit systems can adapt to changing demographics and ensure accessibility for all.
